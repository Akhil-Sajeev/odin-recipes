    <h2>Turkey Soup</h2>
    <p>
        A turkey carcass soup is the answer when you don't want to waste a single
        bite of turkey. This is a delicious soup and one of my favorites. If you
        want to freeze some, leave out the potatoes.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>Make the Broth</h3>
        <li>
            Place the turkey carcass in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a
            boil, then reduce to a simmer and continue cooking until the remaining
            meat falls off the bone. Remove and chop the meat and discard the bones.
            Strain the broth into a clean soup pot.
        </li>

        <h3>Make the Soup</h3>
        <li>
            Add the chopped turkey to the strained broth and bring to a boil. Reduce
            the heat and add the remaining ingredients (tomatoes, potatoes, carrots,
            onion, celery, cabbage, barley, Worcestershire sauce, salt, parsley,
            basil, bay leaf, pepper, paprika, poultry seasoning, and thyme). Cook
            until the vegetables are tender.
        </li>
